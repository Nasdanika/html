    action-template:
      name: Action template
      description: |+2
        Annnotation to load documentation action from a template, e.g. YAML or XML, instead of creating with a factory.
        The action will then be populated as usual. This would allow to, say, have engineering issues at model element level.  
    engineering-generation-target:
      name: Engineering generation target
      description: |+2
        Generate engineering model instead of action model. This would allow to link issues, owners, etc. to model elements.
        Need support for merging.
    emaps:
      name: Display EMaps directly to the value class with a different relationship, e.g. ``#--``
    ekeys:
      name: EKeys as qualifiers - similar to EMaps. Report in documentation. 
    association-classes:
      name: Consider support of association classes using annotations. E.g. an annotation on the association class with target reference name. Say ``association-class-reference`` key with reference name.  
    action-template-annotation:
      name: Action template annotation - location of an action resource to load a template from instead of using AppFactory.createAction(). Would allow to merge, say, navigation actions.
    javadoc:
      name: Javadoc link to instance class.
