  issues:
     - name: Application model as output in addition to YAML
       increment: nasdanika:increments/2021/children/q2  
     - name: Engineering model as output
       description: EClass and EPackage are output as engineered elements. Issues, owner, and other things are loaded using Nasdanika engineering annotation pointing to a yaml file.     
     - name: YAML/load spec
       description: All keys including inherited - changeable, take load-key annotation into account, load-doc annotation to override default description. Sort alphabetically. Table. Homogenous, strict containment, default feature.  
     - name: Display EMaps directly to the value class with a different relationship, e.g. ``#--``
     - name: EKeys as qualifiers - similar to EMaps. Report in documentation. 
     - name: Consider support of association classes using annotations. E.g. an annotation on the association class with target reference name. Say ``association-class-reference`` key with reference name.  
     - name: Action template annotation - location of an action resource to load a template from instead of using AppFactory.createAction(). Would allow to merge, say, navigation actions.
     - name: Support of association classes - annotation on a rereference - reference of the target class which points to the target class. E.g. Alignment aligns Alignable to Aim.
