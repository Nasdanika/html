    generation-api:
      name: Generation API
      description: |+2
        Convert unit tests into a generation API in the main codebase and documentation. Consider also Maven plug-in and CLI. 
    unresolved-proxies:
      name: Unresolved proxies
      description: NPE at FlowStateDiagramGenerator.wire() in the grouping lambda because of unresolved proxy. Unresolved proxies shall be caught earlier in the pipeline. 
    predicate:
      name: Predicate
      description: |+2
        Add support of filtered generation using a predicate service in Context. Perhaps have a specialized interface instead of java function predicate to avoid accidental clash.
        Also the predicate interface may have a method for filtering typed elements - structural features and operations. E.g. hide URI's. Perhaps have this interface in the same 
        package with EObjectActionProvider or even as a nested interface. getPredicate() returns a predicate which accepts everything - to avoid null checks all over.
