                This is a demo of a web site generated from an action model with a Drawio representation.
                Diagram elements below are linked to the pages (actions) of respective components. 
                
                ```drawio
                ${representations/my-system/diagram}
                ```
                
                In this demo only this page (the principal action) has a representation.
                In general there might be multiple representations per action.
                Connections can also be linked to pages or page sections.
        representations:
