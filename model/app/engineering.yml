    carousel-section-style:

    site-map:
      name: Site map
      description: Site map model element by default uses actions contained by the root action. Path to override this behavior - relative to self. Maybe also specify what to include - navigation, children, anonymous, ... And format - jsTree with search, list
    inheritance:    
      name: Ability to inherit action hierarchies and override specific actions
      description: Override by ID. Children will have to be derived and will need "ownChildren" reference with "children" load key.
    js-tree-context-items:
     name: JsTree context items
     description: Label context list of labels. If present use JsTree context menu in the tree and on the page - find how it is done in the old server code on GitHub. In the content panel as well.
    vue-table-component:
     name: Vue table component
     effort: 6
     description: |+2
       Takes storage key and two JSON arrays - columns and items. Column default visibility from column specs, overriden by info from local storage if storage key is specified.
       Filtering, sorting, configuration in a dialog. Vue/BootstrapVue. Store configuration in local storage. Have local storage operations in own methods so it is easy in the future to replace/augment 
       storage mechanism. E.g. store to profile for authenticated users.  
    vue-table-component-column-filtering:
     name: Vue table component column filtering
     effort: 6
     description: |+2
       Column-level filtering - funnel icon in the header opens a modal. If filter is applied the funnel icon changes las la-filter if no filter is applied fas fa-filter if applied. May also simply change color os stack icons, e.g. put in a circle 
       Choices in column specs, e.g. issue statuses. Support of trees - checkbox lists or jsTree with checkboxes. Host as CSS and other JS - GitHub -> jsdelivr. Option to apply filters on columns which are not visible. Clear all filters button.  
    vue-backlins:
     name: Vue backlinks
     description: |+2
       Link validation process generates <page name>-backlinks.js files.
       Pages which "want" to show backlinks declare "Backlinks" navigation action with a Vue app which reads the backlinks.js file. In this case they shall also create <page name>-backlinks.js file with an empty array of backlinks - this file
       will be overwritten by the link validation/collection process.
    problems-page:
     name: Problems page
     description: |+2
       Link validation process generates problems.html with a table or a two-level list. The first level/column - page path with link. The second level/column - a list of problems on the page.
       If a table, may use rowspan for the first column instead of a list in the second.
       The problems.html page can be linked from an action of "hidden" - has to be accessed directly. In the first case may use Vue to have a consistent look.
       Also, in the first case, may have a Vue app to display diagnostics stored in an array or a map of paths to a list of problems. 
       In this case the scanning process will add to the array previously generated by the diagnosing process.
