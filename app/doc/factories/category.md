Category is a group of actions. 
In the UI categories are rendered as different grouping elements depending on their location.
E.g. as cards in the navigation panel, as drop-downs in navigation bars, and as headers or separators in drop-downs.

Category extends [Label](label.html) and as such supports all of its configuration keys plus:

Reference to a category defined in another file/resource.

Category reference supports the following configuration keys:

* ``actions`` - a list of category [actions](action.html).
* ``path`` - If path is specified it is used as a prefix for category's actions URL's.
