  issues:
    hierarchical-tables:    
      name: Hierarchical tables
      description: RowBuilder provider similar as for lists. Perhaps needs to take depth argument so can build indent in the first column.
    temporal-rendering:
      name: Temporal rendering
      description: |+2
        Implement for relative temporals, generate start/end actions for period subclasses if start/end temporals have offset, base, bounds, or derivatives.
        Also info icon in render value navigating to the respective actions. 
    search:
      name: Search functionality
      description: |+2
        Pluggable - some context service for indexing, search functionality in the navigation tree - default (node text) and custom - full text. Lunrjs implementation. Minisearch is also an option. 
        One possibility is to add search configuration to Action, e.g. searchFields String->String map - this may have a problem with unavailability of all text because it may be generated or loaded at a later time. 
        So, maybe scanning the generated pages, parsing them with Jsoup and extracting text from nsd-app-content-panel-content-row and title from nsd-app-content-panel-title or nsd-app-content-panel-title-and-items-row > col > h1 is the way to go.
        Generate search index and store it in the root similar to sitemap.xml. Perhaps ignore Javadoc initially.

      name: Relative URI copy to clipboard
      description: Drop-down or a dialog with a base URI field to compute relative URI's. Use of relative URI's may be preferred in models which are intended to be reused and the root URI may change.
